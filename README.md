# World_Weather_Analysis
The purporse of this project is to collect and analyze weather data across cities worldwide to recommend ideal hotels based on clients' weather preferences. The analysis and data collection was done creating a Pandas DataFrame with world's unique cities and their weather data in real time. With the use of input statements to filter the data based on the user's weather preferences, I was able to identify and create a DataFrame with potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Finally, using Google Maps Directions API, a travel route was created between four cities within the same country that met the weather preferences.
